								<h4>1st year life in UTM</h4>
								<p>During my first year of college, I studied computer science and became fascinated with the realm of algorithms, coding languages, and creative problem-solving. The first few days were a mix of excitement and acclimatization as I worked my way through the subtleties of computer science principles and the difficulties of new programming languages. My scholastic experience was an exciting investigation of the broad domains of programming, ranging from elementary classes in data structures to more specialized topics like machine learning. By combining practical coding assignments with theoretical knowledge, I improved my proficiency in Python, Java, and C++. </p>

								<p>In addition to academic challenges, the campus environment offered a vibrant community of fellow programmers. Working together on projects, taking part in coding contests, and interacting with coding clubs all deepened my knowledge and stoked my enthusiasm for programming. I developed my perseverance and problem-solving skills while I struggled with debugging and optimizing code. In addition to learning syntax and algorithms, the first year focused on laying the groundwork for a future profession in software development. This time of exploration and the friendship of other programmers have prepared the way for what seems to be an interesting voyage into the world of technology and code.</p>
